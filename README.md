# OOP_theory
_INTRO_
In this game, I applied what I learned in the unity jr programmer pathway except UI design because I do not have time. 
_FOCUS_
The balls tries to catch player and push her/him. So, you have to escape from balls but pay attention to fall from the rock. Escape and escape, the balls are coming!
_HOW TO SCRIP IT_
My focus is that apply the OOP theories(Abstraction, inheritance, polymorhism, encapsulation) in the project while creating game mechanics. For example from the project, ball is parent, and children are RedBall and YellowBall. MoveToPlayer() is an example for polymorhism theory, and also speed variable is taken protection through encapsulation theory.
_CONCLUSION_
This is my first reposity. So, there is a fault in my code or I should be long way while solving problems, but I feel that improving myself. Anyway, may be you find something what you want, and it solves your problem. Good luck :)
